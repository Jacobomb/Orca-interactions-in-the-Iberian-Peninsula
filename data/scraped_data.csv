We were relaxing in the cockpit with a podcast playing quite loudly on a portable speaker. It was pitch black as the moon had not yet risen. A lone adult orca (to our knowledge) approached our yacht (Beneteau Oceanis 411) and surfaced about half a metre from our stern. We were only alerted to it's presence when it's blowhole spouted, roughly 0.5 metres off the left side of our stern, right next to our navigation light. It was so close to us that the water from its blowhole hit our chart plotter. We stood up to inspect and saw 1 very large (adult) Orca. We scrambled to grab our foghorn, and 2 x firecrackers that had been passed on to us by fellow sailors. We put on our lifejackets and deployed 1 firecracker into the water, around 1-2 minutes later. We then quickly turned our engine on and motor sailed ahead at full speed, bracing for impact. Luckily, the boat was not hit at all. We motored for around 1 hour before deciding that the coast was clear. There may have been more orcas, but we could not see because it was too dark.","I would describe the behaviour of the Orca during this interaction as placid and curious. I think that it was possibly drawn to us because of our stern light, and perhaps the sound of the autopilot and the loud voices from the podcast being broadcast through our speaker. It did not display any aggressive behaviour, and the fact that it surfaced so close to our stern light indicates to me that it was just curiously checking us out. Given that we were taken completely by surprise, it took us a good few minutes to deploy our deterrent tactics. It would have been only a few metres away from our rudder, and could have easily attacked us if it wanted to."
